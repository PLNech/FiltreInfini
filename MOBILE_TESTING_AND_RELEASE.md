npm run dev:android
```

**Requirements:**

     web-ext sign --api-key=YOUR_KEY --api-secret=YOUR_SECRET
     ```
   - Or manually upload to AMO for self-distribution

   - Tap logo 5 times to enable custom collection
   - Enter your collection owner ID and name
   - Restart Firefox

## üì¶ Firefox Add-ons Submission (Early Release)

### Step 1: Prepare for Submission

1. **Ensure manifest is complete:**
   ```json
   {
     "author": "Your Name",  // ‚Üê Add this
     "homepage_url": "https://github.com/yourname/filtre-infini",  // ‚Üê Add this
     "icons": {  // ‚Üê Already done
       "48": "icons/icon-48.png",
       "96": "icons/icon-96.png",
       "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create icons if missing:**
   ```bash
   # Check if icons exist
   ls icons/

   # If not, create simple colored squares or use an icon generator
   ```

3. **Run linter:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Test build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Step 2: Create Developer Account

1. Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/
2. Sign in with Firefox Account
3. Accept the developer agreement
4. Set up 2FA (recommended)

### Step 3: Submit Extension

1. **Go to Submit page:**
   https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/submit/upload-unlisted

2. **Choose distribution:**
   - **"On this site"** (Recommended for early testing)
     - Will be reviewed by Mozilla
     - Takes 1-3 days for initial review
     - Can mark as "Experimental" for faster review
     - Available on AMO after approval

   - **"On your own"** (Self-distribution)
     - Faster (automatic signing)
     - You distribute the `.xpi` file yourself
     - No AMO listing
     - Good for testing phase

3. **Upload your `.zip` file:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Upload: web-ext-artifacts/filtre_infini-0.1.0.zip
   ```

4. **Fill in metadata:**
   - **Name:** FiltreInfini
   - **Summary:** Advanced tab management for Firefox mobile - powerful queries, bulk operations, and a three-tier workflow
   - **Description:** (Expand on features)
   - **Categories:** Tabs, Productivity
   - **Tags:** tabs, mobile, productivity, organization
   - **License:** GNU GPL v3.0 or later
   - **Privacy Policy:** (Required if collecting data - we're not, so explain that)

5. **Screenshots:** (Take 3-5 screenshots)
   - Main tab list view
   - Query search in action
   - Groups view
   - Metadata modal
   - Bulk operations

6. **Support info:**
   - Support Email or URL
   - GitHub issues URL

### Step 4: Mark as Experimental (Optional - Faster Review)

- Check "This add-on is experimental"
- Helps get faster review for testing
- Users must opt-in to see experimental add-ons
- Can remove this flag later

### Step 5: Wait for Review

**For "On this site" submission:**
- Initial review: 1-3 days
- You'll get email when reviewed
- Common rejection reasons:
  - Missing privacy policy
  - Too broad permissions
  - Code obfuscation
  - Trademark issues

**For "On your own" submission:**
- Automatic signing: ~10 minutes
- Download signed `.xpi`
- Distribute however you want

### Step 6: After Approval

1. **Share the link:**
   ```
   https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/filtre-infini/
   ```

2. **Monitor reviews and feedback**

3. **Update process:**
   - Increment version in `manifest.json`
   - Build and upload new version
   - Each update gets reviewed (usually faster)

## üí° Tips

1. **Start with self-distribution** ("On your own") to test the signing process
2. **Mark as experimental** for faster review during testing phase
3. **Take good screenshots** - they're crucial for user adoption
4. **Write a clear privacy policy** even if simple ("We don't collect any data")
5. **Test on multiple devices** if possible (different screen sizes)
6. **Monitor the review queue** - reviews can take longer during holidays
